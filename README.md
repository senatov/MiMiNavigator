MiMiNavigator is a dual-pane file manager inspired by the classic Total Commander. It provides an efficient way to navigate, view, and manage files across two directories in a split view, designed specifically for macOS.

## System Information

- **OS**: macOS 15.0.1
- **Architecture**: ARM
- **Processor**: M2 Max
- **RAM**: 32 GB

## Developer Tools
- **Swift**: Xcode 16

## Overview
This is a simple training project aimed at fully (as much as possible) replicating the look and functionality of Total Commander to learn Swift development and make use of my newly purchased Mac Studio (I had never used a Mac before). We'll see how far I can take this project and how much my free time and patience will allow.
